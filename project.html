    <h1 class="subheading"> Project Overview </h1>
    <br>
    <p>I would like to create a mobile app which uses our own mobile data to make further predictive recommendations based on previously known interests in literature, films and TV.</p>
    <p>This technology is already being used and similar functionality is being deployed within algorithms developed and used by Youtube and Google where suggestions are displayed based on past use. However, my idea allows you to take ownership of your recommendations. It is not based on large corporations feeding you information to keep you online for longer, subjecting you to more advertising and information supplied by paying customers.</p>
    <p>My app will keep track of things that you have liked and continues to recommend and curate further cultural options which will interest you and expand your knowledge.</p>
    <p>We have a 1:1 relationship with our smart phone, it is the perfect tool to harness knowledge about us so we are able to use our leisure time effectively.</p>

<h2 class="subheading"> Motivation </h2>
<br>
  <p>How often do we procrastinate for ages about what to watch or read next? </p>
  <p>The internet already predictively feeds us information based on prior habits and can have a narrowing effect on what we are exposed to which can have a negative impact, consider conspiracy theories for example where people have gone so far down a rabbit hole they have skewed their perception or beliefs and the information they are being exposed to may become less and less relevant the more time they spend on line. </p>
  <p>The purpose of this app is to understand our interests in culture and offer suggestions for further exploration based on these interests and yet be intelligent enough to broaden our knowledge, not narrow it. </p>
  <p>The internet is vast and overwhelming, current algorithms are not ideally designed to expand our knowledge, we may miss opportunities due to the sheer amount of information available. This functionality does already exist to some extent however I believe it is a growth area and can be fine-tuned at a personal level to allow a person with a smart phone to be offered suggestions immediately as to what to read/watch next to enhance their lives.</p>

<h3 class="subheading"> Description </h2>
  <br>
  <p>The app is stored on your mobile device and can be quite simple in its design initially however has potential to be exceptionally broad and far reaching.</p>
  <p>The initial idea will have a simple cloud database structure which stores all the books, film and television that you have read and watched. This could initially be user input however could extend further down the development path to use AI and machine learning to understand what you have ordered through streaming services or online orders or reviews as examples.</p>
  <p>Based on this stored information further suggestions will be put forward.</p>
  <p>This would require the use of data science, algorithms, AI and machine learning yet again.</p>
  <p>The scope initially can be quite small with perhaps just books, keeping a list of books you’ve read and then using open source code from google or amazon to make recommendations and suggestions for further reading options.</p>
  <p>Further enhancements could include television and film options however the sky is the limit. The app could utilize information about shopping, events, vacation ideas and restaurants and cafes. The opportunities are endless. </p>
  <p>With everything that is going on in our lives this will be a short cut to what is happening around us and specifically tailored to our tastes and interests.</p>
  <p>The interface would be very simple. In its simplest form, the data could be input from the owner of the smart phone, this would require an entry screen.</p>
  <p>However, with more expertise the app would be determining the data stored in the cloud in the background with machine learning capabilities. There is a lot happening in the background.</p>
  <p>The main screen of the app could simply be a short list of recommendations, divided by category ie. Books, television. </p>
  <p>As an example of how the app would work, you could be in a bookstore browsing the shelves, open the app and it will have an immediate recommendation for you. </p>
  <p>The app has done the work for you, and you don’t need to waste time.</p>
  <p>Imagine in the future, walking the streets of a foreign city, you open the app for recommendations and are led directly to something, be it a restaurant, shop or cultural attraction which is perfect for you based on everything you have shown interest in, in the past. You may have missed it. </p>
  <p>No guidebook is curated for you as an individual and although your friends are well meaning in telling you what you must watch/read/visit/eat that is their own taste and may not be compatible with your own.</p>

  <h4 class="subheading"> Tools and Technologies</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Mobile devices (both Apple and Android)</p>
  <p>App development tools. </p>
  <p>Cloud-based toolset: Amazon Web Services (AWS) for data depository and an area for us to use their marketplace plug-ins which is open-source code for data manipulation orchestration this has built in AI and machine-learning code. This is customizable.</p>
<p>There are also other plug ins from Google to allow us to do further data analytics.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
  <h5 class="subheading">Skills Required </h5>
  <p>This is a very difficult and highly specialized project idea. It is also somewhat futuristic and that is why I have outline opportunities for expansion.</p>
  <p>The initial app could be developed using any app development software for both apple and android devices and would require experienced app programmers. </p>
  <p>There will also be a cloud-based database storing information and this requires specific skills.</p>
  <p>The areas of specialization would be in data science, AI understanding and machine learning to analyse the data and formulate the recommendations, this is a highly complex field.</p>
  <p>The available open-source code to do this may also be limiting.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
  <h6 class="subheading">Outcome</h6>
  <p>Currently our data is used by large corporations to manipulate our behaviors and direct us towards opportunities for these corporations to make money.</p>
  <p>I think in the future people will be less inclined to fall for this, despite how clever these companies have become disguising their intentions.</p>
  <p>Hopefully we can take more control of the data we already generate in our connected lives and empower ourselves to use it for purposes that enhance ours.</p>
  <p>There is no doubt that the future will be driven by data to some extent and global markets are affected by the behaviors of the population.</p>
  <p>There should be ethical decisions made by large corporations particularly where it affects the vulnerable. People taking control of their data will hopefully change the way large corporations do business.</p>
